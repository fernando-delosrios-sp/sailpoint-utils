## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: SDK loopback client factory

The connector SHALL pre-configure `sailpoint-api-client` instances from operation input `apiUrl` and `token`, exposing them on `RequestContext.sdk` for the duration of each custom operation invocation.

#### Scenario: Accounts client configured for persist

- **GIVEN** a custom operation receives valid apiUrl and token in its input envelope
- **WHEN** the handler accesses ctx.sdk.accounts
- **THEN** the client SHALL be configured for ISC loopback account create, update, and read used by ctx.persist

#### Scenario: Sources client configured for result source management

- **GIVEN** a custom operation receives valid apiUrl and token in its input envelope
- **WHEN** the handler or framework accesses ctx.sdk.sources
- **THEN** the client SHALL be configured for source lookup, creation, and schema management used by dynamic result source provisioning
