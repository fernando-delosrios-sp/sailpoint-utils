## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: SOD remediation launch operation

The connector SHALL register a custom command `custom:sod-remediation` that prepares an ISC form instance for SOD violation remediation and SHALL NOT execute corrective revokes or mitigating-control application. Implementation SHALL reside under `src/operations/sod-remediation/` with entry module `index.ts`.

#### Scenario: Operation invoked with required inputs

- **GIVEN** `custom:sod-remediation` is declared in connector-spec.json and registered
- **WHEN** ISC invokes the command with input containing `violationId`, `formName`, and standard `requestId`
- **THEN** the handler SHALL fetch the violation, ensure the form definition identified by `formName` exists, create a standalone form instance, and respond with output fields `formUrl` and `situationSummary`

#### Scenario: Recipient defaults to violation owner

- **GIVEN** a violation whose owner identity ID is `owner-a`
- **AND** input does not include `owner`
- **WHEN** `custom:sod-remediation` creates a form instance
- **THEN** the form instance recipient SHALL be identity `owner-a`

#### Scenario: Recipient override via owner input

- **GIVEN** input includes `owner` set to identity ID `owner-b`
- **WHEN** `custom:sod-remediation` creates a form instance
- **THEN** the form instance recipient SHALL be identity `owner-b` regardless of the violation owner

#### Scenario: Form definition created once by name

- **GIVEN** no form definition named `{formName}` exists in the tenant
- **WHEN** `custom:sod-remediation` is invoked with that `formName`
- **THEN** the handler SHALL create a form definition from the bundled seed template in `src/operations/sod-remediation/seed/` using `{formName}` as the definition name
- **AND** subsequent invocations with the same `formName` SHALL reuse the existing definition without patching it

#### Scenario: Form definition owner is access token identity

- **GIVEN** connector config includes a valid access token whose resolved identity ID is `token-owner-id`
- **AND** no form definition named `{formName}` exists in the tenant
- **AND** the violation owner identity ID is `violation-owner-id` where `violation-owner-id` differs from `token-owner-id`
- **WHEN** `custom:sod-remediation` creates the form definition from seed
- **THEN** the form definition owner SHALL be identity `token-owner-id`
- **AND** SHALL NOT use `violation-owner-id` as the form definition owner

#### Scenario: Form definition owner offline fallback

- **GIVEN** invoke runs in offline mode without `apiUrl` and without `token`
- **AND** no form definition named `{formName}` exists
- **WHEN** `custom:sod-remediation` creates the form definition from seed
- **THEN** the form definition owner SHALL use the connector's offline canned owner identity
- **AND** SHALL NOT attempt JWT token identity resolution

#### Scenario: Output contract is minimal

- **GIVEN** a successful launch
- **WHEN** the handler completes
- **THEN** operation output persisted and returned via `ctx.res.send` SHALL include only `formUrl` and `situationSummary` as typed output fields
- **AND** SHALL NOT require output fields `formInstanceId`, `violationId`, `formName`, `formDefinitionId`, or `recipientName`

#### Scenario: Workflow-friendly form keys

- **GIVEN** the seed form definition used for SOD remediation
- **WHEN** a recipient submits the form
- **THEN** submitted `formData` SHALL expose user keys `action`, `remediationSide`, `policyControl`, and `comments`
- **AND** SHALL include hidden launch-populated keys `violationId`, `targetIdentityId`, `groupARevokePayload`, and `groupBRevokePayload` suitable for downstream workflow JSONPath access

#### Scenario: Single-side corrective selection

- **GIVEN** the user selects `action` value `Correct`
- **WHEN** the form is submitted
- **THEN** `formData.remediationSide` SHALL be exactly one of `groupA` or `groupB`

#### Scenario: Auto-discovery registration

- **GIVEN** `src/operations/sod-remediation/index.ts` declares `command: 'custom:sod-remediation'` on its OperationSignature interface
- **WHEN** codegen runs
- **THEN** `custom:sod-remediation` SHALL be registered in auto-registry.ts and listed in connector-spec.json commands

### Requirement: SOD access path resolution

The sod-remediation operation SHALL resolve each conflicting entitlement on a violation side into a display list that includes the entitlement and any access profile or role assigned to the target identity that grants that entitlement. Access path resolution logic SHALL reside under `src/operations/sod-remediation/` and SHALL NOT be part of the generic isc integration layer.

#### Scenario: Entitlement-only side

- **GIVEN** a conflicting entitlement held directly by the target identity
- **WHEN** access paths are resolved for that side
- **THEN** the side display list SHALL include the entitlement
- **AND** the side warning text SHALL use the standard corrective-removal message

#### Scenario: Access profile or role on side

- **GIVEN** a conflicting entitlement granted via an access profile or role assigned to the target identity
- **WHEN** access paths are resolved for that side
- **THEN** the side display list SHALL include the access profile or role in addition to the entitlement
- **AND** the side warning text SHALL state that removing profile- or role-level access may affect other functions of the user

#### Scenario: Hidden revoke payload per side

- **WHEN** form input is assembled for launch
- **THEN** each side SHALL produce a JSON revoke payload including item references and a `recommendedRevoke` entry preferring Role over Access Profile over Entitlement

### Requirement: SOD controls and violation data at launch

The sod-remediation operation SHALL fetch violation details and tenant compensating controls at launch using isc pre-SDK HTTP clients and SHALL assemble operation-specific form input from the results.

#### Scenario: Controls listed at launch

- **WHEN** `custom:sod-remediation` prepares form input
- **THEN** the handler SHALL list tenant compensating controls via the isc controls client
- **AND** SHALL set form launch input indicating whether any controls exist (`hasControls`)

#### Scenario: Empty controls hides mitigate path

- **GIVEN** tenant compensating controls list is empty
- **WHEN** the form instance is created
- **THEN** form input SHALL indicate mitigation is unavailable
- **AND** the situation summary SHALL note that no compensating controls are configured
